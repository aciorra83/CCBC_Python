# Correct the Python code to resolve the KeyError and AttributeError error scenarios:
# KeyError: Check the print statement that uses a key that's not defined in the dictionary.
# AttributeError: Check the attribute defined in the string module.

# Handle the error so that when it occurs, the message Something went wrong is printed to the terminal.

# Write the Python code that will capture and handle the custom exceptions. Here are the steps to follow:
# Subclass the Exception class and create a new Exception class named as Error that contains a message as An exception occurred.
# Use the tryâ€¦except block that will handle the exception and print the message.
class Error(Exception):
    def __init__(self):
        self.message = 'An exception occurred'
try:
